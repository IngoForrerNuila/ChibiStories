            <h3 style="color: orange">THANKS MOM & DAD</h3>
            <div>I want to thank all the readers and my friends for the support and the time you are taking to read this little magazine. 
                But I want to take a pause and dedicate this humble project to my Mother and Father, both gave me a fantastic childhood, 
                all these beautiful memories I have my parents were the ones who made an enormous sacrifice in order to provide me with 
                uncountable happy moments but also: discipline, education, and high moral values to be an empathetic person.</div><br>  

                <div><h4>Celina Maricela Nuila Bonilla & Ingo Pytheas Forrer Haupt</h4> 
                    Thanks for being my family, my parents, 
                    and my friends, I LOVE YOU.
